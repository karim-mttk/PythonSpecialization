# Python Specialization
This repository demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the 
Python language. It aligns closely with the specialization courses 
offered by the University of Michigan and complements the book titled 
'Foundations of Python Programming' used in the university. 
You are encouraged to explore and engage in discussions 
about the code available in this repository.
